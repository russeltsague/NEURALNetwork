As a student completing this traffic sign recognition project, I faced several challenges but learned valuable lessons about implementing convolutional neural networks. The most difficult parts were debugging why my initial model had low accuracy (which turned out to be missing categories in my dataset and insufficient model depth) and ensuring the training and prediction pipelines used identical image preprocessing. Through trial and error, I discovered that adding batch normalization and dropout layers significantly improved performance, while CLAHE contrast enhancement boosted accuracy by nearly 8%. Integrating the model with the Tkinter GUI taught me the importance of maintaining consistent image dimensions and preprocessing between training and prediction. Although frustrating at times when the GUI would freeze during predictions or the model would overfit, I'm proud that my final system achieves 95%+ accuracy while giving me hands-on experience with real-world computer vision challenges like class imbalance and data augmentation. This project deepened my understanding of how theoretical machine learning concepts translate into practical implementations.
